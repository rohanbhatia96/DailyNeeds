Made this project in my 1st year. This is a database project and focuses mainly on the connection between the website and the database.
Not much work was done to make the front end look better.
This project uses PHP and MYSQL for the backend purposes and HTML/PHP for the front end.

Check out some other of my repositories to see my front end work:
